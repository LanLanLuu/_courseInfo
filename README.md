# INF 308: Programming for Informatics

This repository contains the syllabus and example code from class.

Code from class is for educational purposes only; often it will be incomplete or relate to topics discussed in class.
Most code will be made up in class based on student input. It will usually be *a* way of doing things but it won't
necessarily be the *best* way of doing things.
